# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol using Python processes that communicate via TCP. The system consists of a coordinator process that manages distributed transactions across multiple participant processes, ensuring atomicity and consistency in distributed operations.

## Glossary

- **Coordinator**: The central process responsible for managing the two-phase commit protocol and coordinating with all participants
- **Participant**: A process that participates in distributed transactions and responds to coordinator requests
- **Vote_Preference**: A non-deterministic preference (yes/no) that each participant starts with for voting to commit or abort
- **Prepare Phase**: The first phase where the coordinator asks all participants for their vote preference
- **Commit Phase**: The second phase where the coordinator instructs participants to commit or abort based on votes
- **TCP_Communication_System**: The network layer that handles message passing between coordinator and participants
- **2PC_Protocol**: The two-phase commit algorithm implementation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want to run a coordinator process, so that I can manage the two-phase commit protocol across multiple participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coordinator SHALL accept TCP connections from participant processes
2. WHEN the protocol is initiated, THE Coordinator SHALL send prepare requests to all registered participants
3. THE Coordinator SHALL maintain a list of active participant connections
4. THE Coordinator SHALL handle participant connection failures gracefully
5. THE Coordinator SHALL log all protocol states and phase transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want to run participant processes, so that they can participate in the two-phase commit protocol with their vote preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Participant SHALL establish TCP connection to the coordinator process
2. THE Participant SHALL initialize with a non-deterministic vote preference (yes or no)
3. WHEN receiving a prepare request, THE Participant SHALL respond with their vote preference (vote-commit or vote-abort)
4. WHEN receiving a commit request, THE Participant SHALL respond with acknowledgment
5. WHEN receiving an abort request, THE Participant SHALL respond with acknowledgment
6. THE Participant SHALL handle coordinator connection failures and implement timeout mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want the system to implement the two-phase commit protocol, so that all participants reach consensus based on their vote preferences with correctness guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all participants vote-commit in prepare phase, THE Coordinator SHALL send commit requests to all participants
2. IF any participant votes-abort in prepare phase, THEN THE Coordinator SHALL send abort requests to all participants
3. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL ensure that all participants receive the same final decision (commit or abort)
4. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL handle participant failures during commit phase by retrying or logging for manual intervention
5. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL complete the protocol execution and log the final outcome

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want reliable TCP communication between processes, so that messages are delivered correctly during the protocol execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TCP_Communication_System SHALL implement message serialization and deserialization
2. THE TCP_Communication_System SHALL handle network timeouts and connection errors
3. WHEN a message is sent, THE TCP_Communication_System SHALL ensure message delivery or report failure
4. THE TCP_Communication_System SHALL support concurrent connections from multiple participants
5. THE TCP_Communication_System SHALL implement proper connection cleanup on process termination

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want to configure the system with different numbers of participants, so that I can test various distributed scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coordinator SHALL accept configuration for expected number of participants
2. THE Coordinator SHALL wait for all expected participants to connect before accepting transactions
3. WHERE dynamic participant joining is enabled, THE Coordinator SHALL allow participants to join during runtime
4. THE Coordinator SHALL provide status information about connected participants
5. THE Coordinator SHALL handle scenarios where fewer participants connect than expected

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want correctness guarantees for the protocol execution, so that the system maintains consistency across all participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF one participant decides commit, THEN THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL guarantee that every participant voted yes in the prepare phase
2. IF one participant decides abort, THEN THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL guarantee that at least one participant voted no in the prepare phase
3. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL ensure no participant commits while another aborts for the same protocol instance
4. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL maintain these guarantees even in the presence of network delays
5. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL validate correctness conditions before sending final decisions to participants

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can debug and analyze the protocol execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coordinator SHALL log all phase transitions and participant responses
2. THE Participant SHALL log all received requests and sent responses with their vote preferences
3. THE 2PC_Protocol SHALL log protocol outcomes and timing information
4. WHEN failures occur, THE system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
5. THE system SHALL provide configurable log levels for different deployment scenarios
